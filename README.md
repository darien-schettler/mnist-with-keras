#A Jupyter Notebook Exploring and Educating on Basic ML Via Keras & Mnist 

As the title suggests. This is a jupyter notebook that utilizes the tensorflow Keras library to explore the mnist dataset. This notebook has a focus on exploration and education as opposed to high accuracy. It is meant to be useful as a way to explore the ease in which Keras can create models, as well as how to visualize predictions and raw data.

## Getting Started

*NOTE: all shell commands are via the windows command line... you can find alternatives for linux fairly easily* 

1. Clone this repository and navigate into it within the command line
2. Create and activate an environment (if you wish)
	>>> python -m venv env
	>>> env\scripts\activate
(opt.)	>>> python -m pip install --upgrade pip
3. Execute the following commands to install all the requiremets
	>>> pip install -r requirements.txt
4. To open the jupyter environment run the following
	>>> jupyter notebook --port=8888
5. Navigate to the cloned directory and open the .ipynb file

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
