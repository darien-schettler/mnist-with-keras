# A Jupyter Notebook Exploring and Educating on Basic ML Via Keras & Mnist 

As the title suggests. This is a jupyter notebook that utilizes the tensorflow Keras library to explore the mnist dataset. This notebook has a focus on exploration and education as opposed to high accuracy. It is meant to be useful as a way to explore the ease in which Keras can create models, as well as how to visualize predictions and raw data.

`
1. Clone this repository
2. Create an environment (and activate it) and install the requirements.txt file
